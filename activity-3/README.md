# Activity 3: Creating Metadata with dataspice in RStudio
  

### This repository contains the files and related data for Activity 3 in the Spring 2025 course LIS 5493 Data Stewardship.

Subtasks for this assignment included publishing a Quarto Markdown file and the created metadata to GitHub pages. The published metadata file can be viewed [here](https://natalie-elliot.github.io/lis5493/activity-3/dataspice/docs/index.html) and the published .qmd file page can be viewed [here](https://natalie-elliot.github.io/lis5493/activity-3/dataspice-qmd/dataspice-publishing.html).
